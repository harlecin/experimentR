# experimentR
An R package to record model experiments in R.

## Overview
When doing research, we build many different models using:

- different algorithms,
- different hyperparameters
- different datasets and
- different features.

`experimentR` aims to help record experiments and compare them.

## Planned features
To do that the following features are planned:

- logging functionality to capture output of training runs (e.g. from caret/mlr)
- database backend (sqlite and remote database) to save experiments to
- RStudio Addin to analyse experiments
- PowerBI dashboard

Hopefully, the above does not remain a wish list:)
